Processing software for  "A Comodulation Analysis of Atmospheric Energy Injection into the Ground Motion at InSight, Mars" Charalambous, C., Stott, A. E., Pike, T., McClean, J., Warren, T., Spiga, A., ... & Navarro LÃ³pez, S. (2020). A Comodulation Analysis of Atmospheric Energy Injection into the Ground Motion at InSight, Mars. Earth

The code provided here can be run by obtaining the sample datasets as provided in seis-insight... These event files have been pre-processed in order to synchronize the timestamps of pressure, wind and ground acceleration and remove data gaps. All raw data and datasets used in the paper is available for download either at the IRIS Data Management Center, or through the [Mars SEIS Data service MSDS](https://www.seis-insight.eu/en/science/science-summary "SEIS InSight Homepage") doi:10.18715/SEIS.INSIGHT.XB_2016

The authoritative source for the archived InSight data, including all instruments is the Planetary Data System. SEIS data is archived at the [Geosciences node](https://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/insight/index.htm). Wind and pressure data from APSS sensors is archived at the [Atmospheres node](https://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/INSIGHT/insight.html).

THe following MATLAB codes are included for producing the main figures in the paper. The code can easily be adapted to produce the rest of the figures given the parameters suggested in the paper, and can be further experimented by obtaining data as provided in the guidelines above:

Figure1.m - Produces the spectrograms of Figure 1 (Note that the data to run the code are obtained from doi:...). This code can be adapted to produce the spectrograms of other figures in the manuscript with data from doi:10.18715/SEIS.INSIGHT.XB_2016, i.e. Figure 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 & 14. This code requires the removeLow.m function to run.

Figure3b.m - Produces moment-matched time-series and recreates Figure 3b (Note that the data to run the code are obtained from doi:...). By obtaining data from doi:10.18715/SEIS.INSIGHT.XB_2016, this code can be adapted to reproduce other figures in the paper which incorporate the approach of the method of moments to match time series, i.e. Figure 1c, 2b & 14, 

Figure3c.m - Produces comodulation relationships over various frequency bands as shown in Figure 3c. (Note that the data to run the code are obtained from doi:) This code can be adapted to recreate the relationships in Figures 2c,d 4 & 5 by obtaining data from doi:10.18715/SEIS.INSIGHT.XB_2016 .

Figure8.m - This code produces the relationships shown in Figure 8. It uses the envelope of the VBB Z ground acceleration/pressure to obtain predictions of the wind speed over various frequency bands. It also plots the predictions against the measured wind speed. Finally it shows how the mean and variance i.e. the first two moments used to matched the time series, vary across the frequency range.   

SNRAnalysiscode.m - This code calculates and plots the environmental SNR given example datasets for Marsquake events. The output is identical to Figures 11 & 12 of the paper. By obtaining data from doi:10.18715/SEIS.INSIGHT.XB_2016, the code can be adapted to obtain environmental SNRs for all marsquakes as provided in the Marsquake Catalogue V2 doi:10.12686/a7
